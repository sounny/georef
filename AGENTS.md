# Agent Instructions

## Project Description
This repository contains a browser-based affine georeferencing tool inspired by MapWarper's light workflow.
Users can upload a raster image, choose ground control points, compute a six-parameter affine transform,
preview the result on a map, and download matching world and projection files.

## Working Guidelines
- Record every agent interaction in `LOG.md` using a dated Markdown heading followed by bullet points describing changes.
- Keep entries chronological and do not edit previous log items.
- Review existing log entries before starting new work.
- Run any available tests or linters after making changes.
